            <h2>Hi I'm Amy!</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a college student studing Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science at The Ohio State
                University. I will be graduating December 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a SEP Intern at JP Morgan working out of the Columbus office. I am working on a project that aims
                to convert natural language into usable SQL queries.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am interested in all fields of computer science from web development to data engineering to AI/ML but
                am working on narrowing my interests to determine my career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my other interests are various outdoor hobbies like backpacking, snowboarding, and climbing. I
                am currently training for a triathlon. I also enjoy reading and cooking.
